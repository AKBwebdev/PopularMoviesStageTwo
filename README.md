# Popular Movies Stage Two App
*Created as part of Udacity's Android Developer NanoDegree course by Google*

__________________

#### Project Overview

The goal was to design and create a Popular Movies App which would present user with a list of popular movies displayed in the form of a grid view. Each movie when clicked displays further details of the movie, its trailers and review comments. The list of movies displayed in the grid can be changed from Settings (e.g. Popular, Top Rated, Upcoming and Now Playing). A movie can be marked as favorite from the Details screen. All movies marked as favorite are stored in a SQLite Database, and are displayed using a Settings menu to display the favorites collection. 

The app uses TMDb API to get the list of movies.
